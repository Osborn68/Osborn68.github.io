 I have chosen to study software engineering because it is sort of a gateway for me to a piece of the world I didnt think I could gain access to. That came off sort of whimsical... but that is the best way for me to describe how it feels. A little background on me to acertain why I am saying it feels this way. I grew up in a small rural town in a very rural area of Illinois, We are surrounded by grain fields and livestock farms as far as you can see(we did just get a dollar general though!) and most of the jobs close to me have something to do with agriculture or farmwork in general. Not that there is anything wrong with farmwork at all but you can only employ so many people, And farmwork doesnt always tickle everyone's fancy. 

 In my younger years I loved video games (n64 was my jam!) and enjoyed doing what i could on computers (which wasnt much) when I could. In our area during the time, computers were more of a novelty to own, and for schools to teach how to use. So building a understanding of computer software and how to use it definetly wasn't our schools strongsuit. This meant you needed to find a peer group that had access to computers and understood how they work. Only a few of my friends had such access and ability and it wasnt until after high school (none of us where in college) that I met these friends. Even in meeting these friends if you dont know what coding is capable of doing or what jobs are out there for it you never really look into it.

 Fast forward another decade and I am on my journey to becoming a software engineer, It started with a idea my brother threw out during Thanksgiving dinner. A member of his wifes family had recently graduated a bootcamp in Texas and had moved his wife and himself to Austin for a new career. Citing that he had little to no experience with code like me, and was looking for a better more lucrative career for himself and his wife. After our talk I scoured the internet(used my google-fu) and came across multiple different bootcamp schools. I looked through multiple ranking sites, used youtube prolifically(like normal) and tried to find reddit posts on most of these schools to choose where I should start placing my trust. Flatiron started to stand out more and more from their schedule to their supports structure for the students and payment options. From that point forward I started to realize more everyday how much code is involved in things we do, from a Keurig to the way netflix annoyingly asks if your still watching (yes). And I wanted to find out how I could become a part of that community that creates all of the amazing and intuitive things we take for granted. That is why I chose to study software engineering.
